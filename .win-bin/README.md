This folder is for exes needed on windows.  I considered making these side-loaded from the original sources but this gives much better integrity guarantees given that most windows software is sadly delivered over http.

- junction.exe - originally from https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx
- Make is tougher.  make.exe from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3219926/using-make-with-msysgit worked for me on windows 7, but http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm works better on windows 10 so I've included that.
